1. PROJECT TITLE:- DOG OR CAT USING CNN(TENSORFLOW)

I HAVE USED TENSORFLOW AND KERAS TO TRAIN THE MODEL.

I HAVE TRAINED A MODEL OF BINARY CLASSIFICATION WHICH WILL PREDICT WHETHER THE ANIMAL IN THE PICTURE SHOWN IS A DOG OR A CAT.
THIS IS LITERALLY MY FIRST PROJECT IN THIS DOMAIN. 

NOTE THAT THE DATASET HAS NOT BEEN UPLOADED SO THE USER MIGHT HAVE TO UPLOAD THE DATASET ACCORDINGLY TO GET THE MODEL WORKING.
THE MODEL WAS WORKING PERFECTLY WHEN I RUN IT ON MY SYSTEM.
FOR EXECUTION JUST RUN ALL THE CELLS.





2. PROJECT TITLE:- FACE EXPRESSIONS USING CNN(TENSORFLOW)

IN THIS PROJECT, I HAVE TRAINED A CNN WHICH WILL CLASSIFY IMAGES OF HUMAN FACE AS SEVEN DIFFERENT EXPRESSIONS NAMELY- ANGRY, DISGUST, FEAR, HAPPY, NEUTRAL, SAD AND SURPRISE.

I HAVE USED TENSORFLOW AND KERAS TO TRAIN THE MODEL.

VERSION OF TENSORFLOW IS 2.4.1

THE PARENT FILE HAS THE NAME "PCLUB_MODELZOO" AND IT CONTAINS TWO FILES:-
1. THIS README FILE FOR PROJECT DESCRIPTION
2. THE MAIN NOTEBOOK FILE NAMED AS "FACE_EXPRESSIONS.IPYNB"


FOR EXECUTION, SIMPLY OPEN THE ".ipynb" FILE IN JUPITER NOTEBOOK AND RUN ALL THE CELLS.

IMPORTANT NOTE:-

THE DATASET HAS NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE FILE.
THE EXECUTION TAKES A PRETTY LARGE AMOUNT OF TIME.
AT THE LAST, THE CODE WRITTEN IS USED TO MAKE SINGLE PREDICTIONS. THE USER JUST NEEDS TO INPUT AN IMAGE FROM HIS SYSTEM AFTER TRAINING THE MODEL.
DUE TO THE LARGE SIZE OF THE DATASET AND THE CLOSENESS OF THE MODEL TO THE REAL-LIFE SITUATIONS, THE ACCURACY IS ON THE LOWER SIDE.
P.S:- THIS IS MY FIRST MAJOR MODEL WHICH IS SO CLOSELY RELATED TO REAL LIFE SITUATIONS.

THANKS!
